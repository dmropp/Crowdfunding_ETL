# Crowdfunding_ETL

Adam and I(Mitchel Rounds) worked on the coding for this mini project together. I worked on the first section of coding up until cell 52, from then on Adam did the rest of the coding

The crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file is the schema exported from the QuickDBD tool. The crowdfunding_db_schemca_queries.sql file was used to create the tables and includes the SELECT queries to confirm the data was imported correctly.
